dict_word -- handle collision by linked list

learn makefile -- maybe from learn-assembly/x86/day1

# test

setup tdd -- to first write API examples

# parser

# linear type

[maybe] rename VALUE to UINT64

[note] with linear type, programs with local variables can still be composed.

we also need record effects in the type, to support exceptions (throw and try catch)

only simple type (with generic)

[maybe] with an object model (abstract away from pointer)

# learn

read the c book -- learn about array and pointer and struct
read czmq -- learn C API
