# parser

lexer_lex -- handle JSON int

# dict

dict_word -- handle collision by linked list

# learn

read the c book -- learn about array and pointer and struct
read czmq -- learn C API

# device

port uxn console IO -- design better API

port uxn screen IO -- design better API

do something like the uxn screen IO but for 3D!

learn freecad and instead of the editor-based UI,
design a XML-based UI for modelling 3D objects.
