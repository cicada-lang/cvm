read the c book -- learn about array and pointer and struct
learn makefile -- maybe from learn-assembly/x86/day1
setup tdd -- to first write API examples
learn zlist for basic c class example
dict & word -- hash table from word to list of words
- learn from zhash
- [maybe] we should say "word" instead of "symbol"
