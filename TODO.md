tests about literal string -- use VALUE for now

[maybe] rename VALUE to INT
[maybe] add STRING as a instruction for literal string

# parser

use JSON string https://www.json.org/json-en.html

# build

learn makefile -- maybe from learn-assembly/x86/day1

# test

setup tdd -- to first write API examples

# dict

dict_word -- handle collision by linked list
dict_create -- find prime number above given size

# linear type

[note] with linear type, programs with local variables can still be composed.

we also need record effects in the type, to support exceptions (throw and try catch)

only simple type (with generic)

[maybe] with an object model (abstract away from pointer)

# program

program_append_program

# learn

read the c book -- learn about array and pointer and struct
read czmq -- learn C API
